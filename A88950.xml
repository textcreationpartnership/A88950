         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>TIS ſtoryed of <hi>Craeſus</hi> King of <hi>Lydia,</hi> that
when a dumbe Son of his, ſaw a Traitor ready to ſtab his Father, he
conquered the naturall impediments of ſpeech, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly cry'd out,
kill not the King. That which wrought this wonder, was the power of naturall
affection, by the operation of an extraordinary Sympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy. Surely they are
chargeable with a more then brutiſh (even inſenſate) ſtupidity and want
of affection and Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy, who will not now uſe, what nature ordinarily
affords to all (ſpeech at leaſt) yea imploy the primeſt powers and
faculties of ſoule and body, not the tongue and pen only but hearts, heads,
and hands alſo, to reſcue their dear mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, their native Country from
ruine and ſlavery and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore the Father thereof, their liedge Soveraigne
Lord and King, to his juſt rights Crowne and dignity, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve both
from the deſtructive deſignes and Traiterous attempts contrived and
intended againſt them. An honeſt Heathen will not be bribed by the offer of
immortality to doe his Country injury, <hi>ne immortalitatem contra pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triam

            </p>
            <p>Tis a fire in bones and I cannot ſuppreſſe it, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Davids</hi> zeal on this occaſion is to be deſired if I
forget thee O <hi>England,</hi> let my right hand forget &amp;c. if I do not
remember thee, let my tongue cleave to the roofe of my mouth, yea if I preferre
not the good of my King and Country to my cheife joy, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 137.5,

            <pb n="2" facs="tcp:168840:3"/>
            <p>This duty puts the pen into my hand, and (without paint of
Apology) preſſeth me (though leaſt able of any) to declare how
dangerouſly the States Empericks practice upon the Bodies Politick of great
<hi>Brittain</hi> and <hi>Ireland;</hi> making it (as the evill one) their main
work to propagate the ſince of their rebellion unto others, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe well
affected loyal &amp; fai<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>thful to their King &amp; Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try: and their
poyſonous pills are guilded with the pretence of piety, the publick peace,
and ſafety of the people; whereas ſad experience too truly ſhews, nothing
is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, but oppreſſion and ſlavery, confuſion and calamity both
in Church and State to the three Nations; a flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing glorious Commonweald
is pretended and promiſed, whileſt a common woe and miſery, is the ſole
fruit we find of theſe golden promiſes. And the principall deſigne of the
contrivers hereof, being to make themſelves Maſters of thoſe, that
deſerve better ſervants then themſelves, to continue an unlimited command
and domination over the Nations, exerciſe an arbitrary power over the people,
forcing them by an Army (which the people muſt alſo maintain) to ſubmit
to their inſupporable oppreſſive taxes and impoſitions; aſſuming to
themſelves, the diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of all the wealth and treaſure, places of
profit, truſt and honour in the three Kingdomes, yea arrogating a power over
the lives, liberties, and eſtates of the freeborn peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple thereof.</p>
            <p>By this time, I hope tis cleer day, even their eyes whoſe
unwillingneſſe to believe it, made them as blind as <hi>Barti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meus,</hi>
are now open and awake; to ſee how ſadly a ſetled happy Government is
ſubverted our lawfull liberties in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringed, our fundamentall laws contemned
and everted, and freemen made vaſſals to vile uſurpers, ſo that we may
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:168840:3"/>take up that ſad lamentation with
<hi>Jeremiah, Lam.</hi> 5.5, 8, 12, 14, 15, 16. Our necks are under
perſecution: we are weary and have no reſt: Servants have ruled over us,
none would deliver us out of their hands. The Princes are hanged up by their
hands: the faces of the Elders were not had in honour. The Elders ceaſed from
the gate; there is no law nor form of Government, the joy of our heart is gone,
our dance is turned into mourning. The Crown of our head is fallen, woe now
unto us, that we have ſinned, ver. 12, 14, 15, 16. Our Idolatry of a
pretended Parliament and rebellion againſt our King, hath brought this woe
up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us whiles we waited for our vain help, our eyes fail for in our waiting,
we looked for a people that could not ſave us, <hi>Sam.</hi> 4.17. There the
Prophet ſets forth a two-fold cauſe of <hi>Iſraels</hi> deſtruction,
their cruelty and their vaine confidence in an arm of fleſh, which is
curſed. <hi>Jer.</hi> 17.5. <hi>Curſed be the man that truſteth in man,
and maketh fleſh his arm, and</hi> Iſa. 31.1, 3. <hi>Woe unto them that
ſtay upon their horſes and truſt in horſemen: the help, and the helped
ſhall fall and faile together.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Breath of our Noſtrels, the annointed of the Lord was taken
in their nets, of whom we ſaid under his ſhadow, we ſhall be preſerved,
our good King <hi>Joſiah</hi> is ſlain by them ver. 20. doth not the
Prophet ſpeak of our times think yee? I am ſure tis a perfect paralell of
our preſent condition. And not unlike to this, is that of the Prophet
<hi>Iſaiah,</hi> where a Chaos like confuſion is deſcribed. The Nobles
thereof ſhall call to the Kingdome, and there ſhall be none none, and all
the Princes thereof ſhall be as nothing, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 34.12. &amp;c.
Intimating that there ſhall be neither order, nor policy, nor ſtate, nor
Commonweale, a ſad preſage for any place or people: yet this hath been the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:168840:4"/>portion of theſe Nations, for almoſt
twenty years laſt paſt.</p>
            <p>God by his Prophet <hi>Zachariah</hi> ſharply chargeth
<hi>Iſrael,</hi> as juſtly he may <hi>England,</hi> with great ingratitude,
which would not be ruled by his moſt beautifull order of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, nor
continue in the bands of brotherly unity; and therefore he breaketh the two
ſtaves of beauty and bands; the beauty of orderly Government, &amp; bands of
uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, <hi>Zech.</hi> 11. Not unlike that judgement denounced againſt
<hi>Iſrael,</hi> for the wilde Grapes: I will take away the hedge and fence
from the vineyard, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 5.4.5. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So the Foxes of the
Wood and the Bores of the Forreſt may devour &amp; deſtroy. So here the
Lord menaceth them with mercileſs deſtructive Governors, who ſhould
conſume them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any remorſe, thinking they did no evil. They that
poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe them ſlay them, and ſin nor: and they that ſell them
ſay, bleſſed be the Lord for I am rich: <hi>Zech.</hi> 11.5.
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> Their own ſheephards ſpare them not: A juſt judgment,
upon them that ſpared not their milde and gentle Ruler, therefore
oppreſſing Hypocrites are ſet over them; who have the name of God in
their mouths, but in their doings deny God; attributing their gain to Gods
bleſſing, which cometh of the ſpoile of their brethren: and for thoſe
and ſuch like accounts have daies ſet apart for publick thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving.</p>
            <p>The Children of <hi>Iſraell</hi> (ſaith the Prophet
<hi>Hoſea</hi>) ſhall remain many daies without a <hi>KING,</hi> and
with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Prince, and without an Offering, and without an Ephod, and without
Teraphim, &amp;c. <hi>Hoſea</hi> 3.4 ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying that they ſhould have
neither Religion nor Policy, Eccleſiaſticall nor Civill Government, and
their Idolls wherein they truſted ſhould be deſtroyed, as the margent
renders it. Hath not this propheſy had full accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:168840:4"/>in <hi>England?</hi> hath not that
Beautifull and flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Government both in Church and State ſetled, and
famous throughout Chriſtendome, been not for many daies onely, but many years
broken and interrupted? and the Idolized Parliament the cauſe thereof, and
many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther dolefull breaches in the Nations, often alſo diſſolved, and
now totally determined, and infamouſly branded with an odious name of
unfavoury reproach? and their pillars of power, their arm of fleſh ſhrunk
up, and like <hi>Jeroboams</hi> hand withered, moſt of their principall
Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers caſhier'd, &amp;c. who ſeeth not the hand of God here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in? none
but <hi>digitus dei</hi> hath done this.</p>
            <p>The Prophet proceeds in the next verſe to preſcribe a cure for
this confuſion, <hi>verſ.</hi> 5. Afterward ſhall the Children of
<hi>Iſraell</hi> returne, convert, and ſeek the Lord their God, and
<hi>David</hi> their King, and ſhall feare the Lord, and his Goodneſſe in
latter daies. The accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment hereof is at hand, The Lord hath touched
the hearts of the People, and now after they have taſted the bitter fruit
ariſing and growing from the root of Rebellion, which beareth nought but the
wormwood of woe &amp; wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, and the gall of grief and
oppreſſion, they feel and find the want of their gracious <hi>KING,</hi>
and of an hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Government under him, and reſolve to returne from Rebellion,
and call home their baniſhed, and reſtore their lawfull <hi>KING
CHARLES,</hi> the moſt renouned Prince in Chriſtendom to his rightfull
Throne and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion.</p>
            <p>The ſame Prophet proceeds, <hi>cap.</hi> 10. to ſhew how the
great diſpoſer, in whoſe hands are the hearts of both <hi>King.</hi>
&amp; People, hath changed the Subjects hearts; ſo that in ſtead of their
former crucifige's, they are now ready to receive <pb n="5" facs="tcp:168840:5"/>their
<hi>King</hi> with <hi>Hoſannahs</hi> and <hi>Allelviahs,</hi> and to make
Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantation of their rebellion; their heart is divided, and now are they found
faulty: for now they ſhall ſay we have no <hi>King:</hi> becauſe we
feared not the Lord: is not our condition correſpondent to <hi>Iſraels</hi>
in that reſpect? may we not ſay truly, that the want of the fear of God
hath been the cauſe we have ſo long wanted our <hi>Kin?g</hi> behold
ſaith the Lord the voice of the cry of the people; is not the Lord in
<hi>Zion, Jer.</hi> 8.19. in <hi>England?</hi> Is not her <hi>King</hi> in her?
why have they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked me to anger? intimating that, as an argument of his
diſpleaſure, hath nor the Government been toſs'd and tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled from hand
to hand, and none ſtands, ſtill remaines un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetled? Hath not the Lord
divided the hearts of the people and ſtill continues a ſpirit of diviſion
among them, that they ſhall not unite, untill he come whoſe right it is to
rule theſe Nations? Set up what Governors or Goverment you can, with all your
turning deviſes, contrive to reſiſt your true <hi>King,</hi> there is a
<hi>mene, mene,</hi> &amp;c. ordained for preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all your deſignes.
The hand writing on the wall ſhall ſet you on ſhaking, ſo that all your
powers and policys ſhall fall and fail, <hi>a tremor cordis</hi> ſhall
poſſeſſe you, trembling of ſoul ſhall cerify you, and God ſhall
blaſt all thoſe unjuſt enterpriſes, that tend to the reſiſtance of
the <hi>Kings</hi> reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, with a triple defeate and diſappointment.
Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that of the Prophet <hi>Ezek.</hi> 21.27. I will overturn,
overturn, overturn, and it ſhall be no more, untill he come whoſe right it
is and I will give it him.</p>
            <p>But hereof more in the next, this being but the firſt of ſeven
ſtars, which (by divine aſſiſtance) ſhall be ſet forth to ſhine
as bright beams and illuſtrious rayes of the Sun like glory of this right
<hi>Royall Plant of Renown.</hi>
